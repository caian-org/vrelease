# `vrelease`

<img src=".docs/icon.svg" height="240px" align="right"/>

`vrelease` is a lightweight and straightforward release tool for GitHub and
GitLab. It is packed as a single binary that requires no configuration file and
weights under 200kb. This tool is also:

- **Simple:** All required parameters are detected automatically
- **Minimal:** `git` is the only external program necessary
- **Agnostic:** Language independent alternative for [`goreleaser`][goreleaser]
- **CI/CD ready:** Designed to be integrated in CI/CD pipelines of any provider

## How can I use it?

`vrelease` is a tool that **generates releases on GitHub and GitLab**. It
should be used in the context of a CI/CD pipeline, at the delivery stage. The
pipeline should be declared in a way that, when a new tag is pushed, the tool
is executed after the tests passed, so a new release is automatically created
with changelog.

</p>
<br/>

The tool lists all the project's tags and compare the changes from the last tag
to the current one -- If no last tag is detected, it will use the master branch
as the last reference. It then formats the log to an HTML changelog and creates
on the provider via an API call. The username, repository name, connection
protocol (HTTPS or SSH) and provider (GitHub or GitLab) detection is based upon
the repository remote URL.

Optionally, one or more artifacts can be attached to the release. The title and
a message/description can also be added using the last commit that closes the
tag. The API authentication to either GitHub or GitLab is made by tokens. The
token should be generated for you account and exposed inside the pipeline via
the `VRELEASE_AUTH_TOKEN` environment variable.


### Execution example

[This commit][ex-commit] closes the `v1.1.0` tag of [this project][ex-proj].
When using the following command:

```sh
vrelease --add-checksum --add-description --attach my_artifact
```

The generated release looks [like this][ex-release]

[ex-commit]: https://github.com/vrelease/vrtp/commit/6174cf7f03f741e4652d70e85a633277ce5f1069
[ex-proj]: https://github.com/vrelease/vrtp
[ex-release]: https://github.com/vrelease/vrtp/releases/tag/v1.1.0

## How can I get it?

`vrelease` is distributed in many pre-built forms:

- For NodeJS projects, use the [js-wrapper][vr-js];
- For Python projects, use the [py-wrapper][vr-py];
- For MacOS systems, use the [homebrew-formula][vr-brew];
- For Docker-based systems, use the [docker-image][vr-docker];
- For all other needs, download from the [releases page][vr-rels];

[vr-js]: https://github.com/vrelease/js-wrapper
[vr-py]: https://github.com/vrelease/py-wrapper
[vr-brew]: https://github.com/vrelease/homebrew-formula
[vr-docker]: https://github.com/vrelease/docker-image
[vr-rels]: https://github.com/vrelease/vrelease/releases

You can also build from source:

`vrelease` is implemented in [Nim][nim], a language inspired by Python, Ada and
Modula that compiles to C, C++ and JavaScript. After downloading and installing
Nim, use make (see [`Makefile`][makefile]) with `release`:

```sh
make release
```
